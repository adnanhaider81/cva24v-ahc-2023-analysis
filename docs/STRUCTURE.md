# Structural modeling how-to
1. Export VP1 FASTA from results/aln/vp1_input.fasta.
2. Submit to Robetta for homology modeling. Keep default parameters unless needed.
3. Download PDB models, open in UCSF Chimera.
4. Use MatchMaker to align 2005 vs 2023 models.
5. Inspect N-terminal region for positions 16 and 25 and record surface and volume metrics.
